Project carried out as part of the subject [*Object Oriented Programming*](https://syllabuskrk.agh.edu.pl/2017-2018/en/magnesite/study_plans/stacjonarne-informatyka/module/iin-1-302-s-zimowy-object-oriented-programming).

The purpose of the project was creating a traffic simulator, that:
* allows changing traffic lights, 
* allows adjusting animation speed and number of vehicles,
* provides data on traffic jams. 

The ***Simulation.java*** file contains a set of functions that can be used to create vertical or horizontal roads with any number of lanes.

An example of using the functions is given in the file ***Main.java***, and the animation below.
